are the results measurable?\\
time-int sens: $\SI{1.68e-14}{\tera\electronvolt\tothe{-1}\centi\meter\tothe{-1}\second\tothe{-1}}$ per source\\
time-int disc $\num{5}\sigma$: $\SI{6.81e-14}{\tera\electronvolt\tothe{-1}\centi\meter\tothe{-1}\second\tothe{-1}}$ per source\\
one magnitude under all-sky\\
time-int total flux of $\SI{4.11}{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}\second\tothe{-1}}$ calculated as thorben at $\SI{100}{\tera\electronvolt}$ reference\\
time-dep sens, best: $\SI{4.63e-2}{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}}$ at $\SI{1}{\tera\electronvolt}$ reference\\
time-dep disc $\num{5}\sigma$, best: $\SI{1.32e-1}{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}}$ at $\SI{1}{\tera\electronvolt}$ reference\\
time-dep weighted per burst fluence of $\SI{34.91}{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}}$ calculated as thorben at $\SI{100}{\tera\electronvolt}$ reference\\
\textbf{how do I go from 1TeV to 100TeV}\\
martina karl: disc $\SI{2.7e-2}{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}}$ with $\num{3}\sigma$ but \textbf{what reference energy?}\\
compare both analyses, \textbf{but how?}\\
compare with other analyses\\

what could have been done better, whats weird:\\
- mc gfu gold events about times 2: 21002 21220 are weird\\
- source 37 has few trials\\
- more trials; timewindow distribution could be smoother\\
- maybe theres a background event which is an outlier that gets badly scrambled\\
- post trials should be done or all sources\\
- different gammas\\
- take gamma of gfu gold events\\
- spatial errors of sources could be accounted for\\
- take newest version of ps\_tracks\\
why no unblinding?\\
- takes too long\\

All in all, this work provides a good basis for getting started with point source searches using \texttt{csky} and can be used for further analyses by making minor changes.
For example, the data set can be enlarged or additional or different source locations can be investigated.
