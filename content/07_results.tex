are the results measurable?\\
compare both analyses\\
compare with other analyses\\

what could have been done better, whats weird:\\
- mc gfu gold events about times 2: 21002 21220 are weird\\
- post trials should be done or all sources\\
- different gammas\\
- take gamma of gfu gold events\\
- spatial errors of sources could be accounted for\\
- take newest version of ps\_tracks\\
why no unblinding?\\
- takes too long\\

All in all, this work provides a good basis for getting started with point source searches using \textbf{csky} and can be used for further analyses by making minor changes.
For example, the data set can be enlarged or additional or different source locations can be investigated.
