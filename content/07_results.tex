compare with other analyses\\

what could have been done better, whats weird:\\
- mc gfu gold events about times 2: 21002 21220 are weird\\

- spatial errors of sources could be accounted for\\
- take newest version of ps\_tracks\\

- takes too long\\

this thesis gives good framework for similar analyses that could be done with csky
