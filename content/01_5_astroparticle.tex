\section{Neutrino Sources and their Properties}

AGN: hadronic SED stuff\\
SBG: energies n stuff\\
other sources?

\subsection{Blazars}
- type of AGN \\
- inner jets cannot explain sub-PeV neutrino events cause of low energy cutoff \\
- needs more complicated models \\
\cite{blazar}

\subsection{Starburstgalaxies}
%- starburstgalaxies are galaxies with star formation at extreme levels\\
%- example: Arp 220\\
%- consists of two nuclei\\
%- star formation rate of > 100 sun mass per year\\
%- "Arp 220 is a hadronic cosmic ray calorimeter where all the power in %cosmic rays is absorbed within the nuclear starburst zones"\\
%- up to a hundred percent proton calorimeters\\
%- pp interaction -> pions -> 1.neutrino + charged lepton\\
%- flux of 1. neutrino is about $\num{6e-%12}\si{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}\second\tothe{-1}}$ at %$\SI{0.1}{\peta\electronvolt}$\\
%\cite{starburst}
%- neutrinos from pp have a typical energy of about %$\SI{2}{\peta\electronvolt}$
%\cite{starburst2}

Apart from blazars, starburstgalaxies are candidates for the production of neutrinos of energies up to about $\SI{2}{\peta\electronvolt}$ \cite{starburst2}.
These are galaxies in which stars form at extreme levels.
One example is Arp 220, an object consisting of two nuclei surrounded by dense molecular gas.
The gas turns the object almost completely into a cosmic ray calorimeter.
Under certain model assumptions, the $pp$-interactions provide a neutrino flux for the first part of the interaction of about $\num{6e-12}\si{\giga\electronvolt\centi\meter\tothe{-2}\second\tothe{-1}}$ at $\SI{0.1}{\peta\electronvolt}$ \cite{starburst}.
