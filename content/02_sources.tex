There are various approaches to examining different areas of the sky for neutrino point sources.
While all-sky scans examine entire declination bands of the sky \cite{some_all_sky_scan}, there is also the alternative of examining individual points in the sky.
This is done via a predefined source catalogue, which is often motivated by special signals coming from these directions, such as high-energy photons or, as in this thesis, neutrinos, which have a high probability of being of astrophysical origin.
IceCube has a realtime alert system that reports and collects such special events.
Originally, neutrino alerts were divided into High Energy Starting Event (HESE) and Extremely High Energy (EHE) signatures.
The HESE events originate qualitatively from neutrinos that interact directly in the detector, meaning that the interaction starts there, while EHE events only have a very high energy.
Eventually, the alert system was modified.
Besides a few tweaks to the HESE and EHE channels, the new alert system introduced a breakdown into two different categories of events based on their probability of being of atrophysical origin.
These are called gold and bronze events, with gold having at least a $\SI{50}{\percent}$ astrophysical purity in comparison to $\SI{30}{\percent}$ for bronze events.
The latter were introduced to satisfy the demand for even more alerts.
This new system also features a new event type, the Gamma-Ray-Followup (GFU), which is highest in the event categorization hierarchy, meaning that if an event is classified as a GFU event it is also possible for the event to be a HESE or EHE event additionally.
This hierarchy is based on studies for angular resolution and astrophysical purity making GFU gold events the first stop for a search for astrophysical neutrino sources \cite{Aartsen_2017}.

\section{Gamma-Ray-Followup}

The Gamma-Ray-Followup track selection, GFU for short, is a pretrained binary decision tree (BDT) identifying through going single track events from all directions that are likely neutrino induced.
The required astrophysical purity of at least $\SI{50}{\percent}$ for the gold selection is obtained by tight cuts on muon energy and deposited charge.\\
The BDT consists of two basic cuts different for each hemisphere.
Both, for upgoing and downgoing events, use a precut which is more like a sanity check outruling invalid events.
All events having a tracklength greater than $\SI{0}{\meter}$ and a truncated energy greater than $\SI{0}{\electronvolt}$ pass this selection.
Additionally all events have to be between $\SI{82}{\degree}$ and $\SI{-82}{\degree}$ zenith.
Events from the northern sky must have a truncated energy higher than $\SI{1e5.14}{\giga\electronvolt}$ to pass the GFU selection.
In the southern hemisphere, the deposited charge ($qtot$) of the events must meet the following condition as a function $d$,
\begin{equation}
  \log_{10}(qtot) > -4.06580\cdot d^3 - 10.60906\cdot d^2  -9.61048\cdot d + 3.01219,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the sine of the declination of the events.
The individual signalness is obtained through a grid interpolation based on the position of these events \cite{track_alert_paper}.

\subsection{Sources}

The selected sources in this analysis are part of the alert catalogue version 2 which features about 300 alerts in total.
The GFU-gold alerts used as sources are displayed in table \ref{tab:sources}.
These events are also visible in figure \ref{fig:skymap_1}.
All events used are in an energy range of $\SI{174}{\tera\electronvolt}$ to $\SI{5960}{\tera\electronvolt}$.
The sources used in the later introduced time-dependent analysis are shown in figure \ref{fig:skymap_2}.
It is worth mentioning that the time integrated analysis uses all sources listed in the table \ref{tab:sources}, regardless of the time interval of the dataset used.
The sources in the time-dependent analysis, on the other hand, are all temporally located in the dataset presented in the chapter \ref{sec:data} and can additionally be seen in table \ref{tab:sources_time_dep}.
