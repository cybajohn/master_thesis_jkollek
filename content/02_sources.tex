Historically events were categorized between high energy starting events (HESE) and extremely high energy events (EHE).
Starting events are as the name suggests events starting inside the detector volume (interaction vertex)

\section{Gamma-Ray-Followup}

The Gamma-Ray-Followup track selection, GFU for short, is a pretrained binary decision tree (BDT) identifying through going single track events from all directions that are likely neutrino induced.
The required astrophysical purity of at least $\SI{50}{\percent}$ for the gold selection is obtained by tight cuts on muon energy and charge.\\
The BDT consists of two basic cuts different for each hemisphere.
Both, for upgoing and downgoing events, use a precut which is more like a sanity check outruling invalid events.
All events having a tracklength greater than $\SI{0}{\meter}$ and a truncated energy greater than $\SI{0}{\electronvolt}$ pass this selection.
Additionally all events have to be between $\SI{82}{\radian}$ and $\SI{-82}{\radian}$ zenith.
Events from the northern sky must have a truncated energy higher than $\SI{1e5.14}{\giga\electronvolt}$ to pass the GFU selection.
In the southern hemisphere, the deposited charge ($qtot$) of the events must meet the following condition as a function $d$,
\begin{equation}
  \log_{10}(qtot) > -4.06580\cdot d^3 - 10.60906\cdot d^2  -9.61048\cdot d + 3.01219,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the sine of the declination of the events.
The individual signalness is obtained through a grid interpolation based on the position of these events.
